        <p>
            I am a web application developer at TWG. I work with technologies that include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Right now I am mostly focusing on Vue and React.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love building design-minded websites with a strong focus on code readability, accessibility, and clean, beautiful design.
